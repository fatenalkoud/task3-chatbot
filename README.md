# task3-chatbot
I uploaded two files
-The first is in HTML format
It contains the code for the first and second task, with a chat bot added to it. You can open it and talk to the chat

To facilitate speaking, I will suggest what you say to him
-How are you doing
or You can also ask him about:

-When are you working?

And he will answer you, God willing


-Second file in Jison format
I just downloaded it from the IBM website
